## Overview ##

NHS Digital have uploaded the MESH Server API onto the Apiary [website](http://docs.meshapi.apiary.io/). This enables developers to test the MESH API and provides sample code in a number of different programming languages.

The MESH API page is shown below:

The pages provide details of each of the HTTP Messages in the REST API:

1. If you click on MESH Messages link ‘Reference’ label in the left menu. 
2. You will then be presented with the details of the messages in the middle of the screen, clicking on a message title will show the details of the parameters for this message.
3. You can then select which language you want to develop in to get sample code to create & send the appropriate HTTP Request.

NHS Digital have also written Python & Java classes to assist in the authentication elements and these are available on request.
