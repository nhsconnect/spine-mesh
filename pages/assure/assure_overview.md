To ensure that suppliers implement the MESH Server API correctly they will be required to perform a light-touch Compliance testing before being able to connect to the Live environment. Managed by NHS Digitalâ€™s Solution Assurance team, the test will cover:

1. Using the PTL environment, the supplier will request SA support to execute and submit evidence for review by the Solution Assurance team. This will consist of a small number of tests which will verify the API implementation as defined in the MESH API specification. The supplier will ensure that the messages and responses are handled correctly by the system under test.
2. The Supplier will work with the Solution Assurance team to complete the MESH API requirements. These will be approved by the Solution Assurance team.
3. On successful completion of the MESH API requirement testing and evidence review, an appropriate certificate of completion for First of Type or an uplifted DevMAC will be awarded by the Solution Assurance team.

A separate document detailing the requirements for the Compliance test is available.
