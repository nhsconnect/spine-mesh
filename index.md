## Introduction ##

An introduction to provide users of Spine2 with the information required to utilise the MESH Server Application Programming Interface (API).

## Background ##

The BT contract for provision of the Data Transfer Service (DTS) ended on 30 June 2016.  NHS Digital has developed a replacement for DTS which is an in-house managed service. This transition has enabled NHS Digital to introduce a number of service improvements and deliver cost savings.  One of these improvements includes exposing the MESH Service API to enable systems that use MESH to communicate directly with the service without the need to install and use the MESH client.   The MESH Server API is the same interface as the one used by the MESH client to communicate with the MESH service.

## Contact Us ##

For further information on how to use the MESH API and the related compliance testing requirements, please contact MESH team on [mesh@nhs.net](mailto://mesh@nhs.net). 

In addition, a dedicated [MESH page](http://systems.digital.nhs.uk/ddc/mesh) has been created on the NHS Digital website. If users have specific question related to MESH please contact the National Service Desk.
